        <p>War Thunder is the game that I play the most, and for a good reason. You can play a huge variety of planes 
        and tanks from across 6 nations! These nations are: The United States, Germany, Russia, Great Britain, Japan 
        and Italy. As you can probably tell these are the main countries that took place in WWII, and that is the era
        that this game focuses on.</p>

        <center><h2>Game Modes</h2></center>
        <p>There are a variety of game modes to play, and they are all extremely fun. First, there are air arcede battles, 
        wich is the easiest game mode due to the fact that manuverability is better and you get a little target bext to the 
        enemy plane so you know how much leed you need to pull to hit your target. Then there are tank arcede battles. This
        is also the easiest of the tank battle modes. This is because the speed of your tank and the traverse rate of your turret 
        is greatly increased, There is also a round penetration indicator to you can tell if the round will go through the enemy 
        tank's armour and do any damage to the internals of the tank. Next, there is air realistic battles, wich requires
        a considerable more amount of skil than air arcade. The planes manuver a lot worse and there is no redicle. What 
        this means is that you have to know your plane's weapons to know where to shoot to hit your target. You also have to take 
        off at the start of a game, whereas in arcade battles you spawn in the air. Tank realistic battles also require a lot more 
        skill than tank arcade battles. There are no tags identifying enemy tanks, so you must pick them out with your own eyes. There 
        is also no armor penatration indicator, wich means that you have to shoot the enemy tank in places that you know don't have as
        much armor so your round can penatrate and do dammage. Lastly, there are simulator battles (sb). In air sb you are only limited 
        to the cockpit view instead of the third person view. The physics are also like what they would be in real life, and taking off
        and landing is a lot more difficult. There are also no identification tags for the enemy or even your teammates, whereas 
        in ab and rb there are tags for both the enemy and your teammates. In tank ab there are also no tags for you or your teammates, 
        so it is important that you know what tanks of your nation look like so you don't accidently kill your teammates. You are 
        also only limmited to to the commander view or the gunner views so again, no third person. Tank movement is also a lot 
        more realistic.</p>

        <center><h2>Types of Tanks and Planes</h2></center>
        <p>For planes there are a wide variety of aircraft. There are fighters, heavy fighters, bombers, attackers and hydroplanes. 
        All the types of viechles and planes play a significent role in the team's success. </p>
